# SpeedScore

This repository contains the code for SpeedScore, a single page web application that supports the sport of speedgolf by allowing users to

-   log and analyze their speedgolf rounds
-   share and discuss their speedgolf rounds with other speedgolfers
-   add detailed golf, running, and topographical data on speedgolf-friendly to SpeedScore's course database

SpeedScore is implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It presently stores all app data locally in `localStorage`. In the future, it will also store app data in a cloud-based database.

To run SpeedScore from Visual Studio Code, type
`npm run start`
in the terminal.
